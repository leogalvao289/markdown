1. How do you see the files changed within each commit from git log?

list of commits made to the repository appears in reverse chronological order; that is, the most recent commit appears first
the author's name and email, date of insertion, and the commit message.

-p, which shows the differences introduced in each commit. You can also use -2, which lists only the last two items on the return.

head: Show the first lines of a file, as for example with head -10 a.txt, or used as a filter to show only the first x results of another command
